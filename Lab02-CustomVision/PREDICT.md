## Accessing the prediction endpoint using REST API

In this section of the lab, we will demonstrate how to access the REST prediction endpoint exposed by your service.
The instructor will walk you through `predict.ipynb` Jupyter notebook that illustrates how to use Python SDK to access the service.

Before proceeding make sure to mark the current version of your model as the default iteration.
